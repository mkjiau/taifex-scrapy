# Overview

This is a [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) project which can be used to crawl [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) website to scrape movies' information and then store the data in `json` format. 

## Crawling

1. Clone the repo and navigate into `IMDB-Scraper` folder.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dojutsu-user/IMDB-Scraper.git
$ cd IMDB-Scraper/
```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
```
(IMDB-Scraper) $ pipenv shell
```
3. Install all dependencies.
```
(IMDB-Scraper) $ pipenv install
```
4. Navigate into `imdb_scraper` folder.
```
(IMDB-Scraper) $ cd imdb_scraper/
```
5. You can change the starting page of the crawler in the file `imdb_scraper/spiders/movie.py` by changing the `SEARCH_QUERY` variable. You can get your own query from here: [imdb.com/search/title](https://www.imdb.com/search/title). Copy the generated URL and paste it in place of default url. By default:
```python3
SEARCH_QUERY = (
    'https://www.imdb.com/search/title?'
    'title_type=feature&'
    'user_rating=1.0,10.0&'
    'countries=us&'
    'languages=en&'
    'count=250&'
    'view=simple'
)
```
7. Start the crawler.
```
(IMDB-Scraper) $ scrapy crawl movie
```
8. Data will be stored in `json` file named `movie.json` located at `IMDB-Scraper/imdb-scraper/data/movie.json`.


The final data will be in the form:

```

    {
        ...
